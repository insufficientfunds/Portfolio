	<h1>Synopsis of Networks and Data Communication Course</h1>

<h3></h3>	

<p>
This course seeks to accomplish many things.
It's foundation and ultimate course objective is to educate students 
on designs and specifications required for transmission of data within networks. </p>

<p>
In turn, this will spur on a student's knowledge of data communications and networking basics, appropriations that go along with communication, increased knowledge of computer application and its relation to facilitating entriprise goals.

<p>What I learned: <br></br>
In this video lecture presented by the Scholartica Channel, I learned about
the flow of message in the TCP/IP and OSI Reference Models. As described in the introduction, this illustration serves the purpose of showing how data is transferred from a computer on one network to a computer on another network. This transfer of information can be done via cables or by using wireless technology. I also learned that the OSI model has a theoretical backing. </p>
<br></br>
<p>Things I like: <br></br>
In this video lecture presented by the Scholartica Channel, I liked the 
animations that were used to illustrate the processes that take place in a TCP/IP model. As each header was added in the TCP/IP model, the narrator paused to describe the addition and circled the header in each step. I also liked the comparison chart illustrating the differences between a TCP/IP model and an OSI model. Also, I liked how the narrator spoke slowly so that the viewer could absorb the content more thoroughly (and for international audiences this might help as well). </p>
<br></br>
<p>Things I don't like : <br></br>
In this video lecture presented by the Scholartica Channel, I did not like the organization of the material. For instance, in the introduction, the presenter indicates the OSI model first in the learning objectives but then goes on to present the TCP/IP model intially in the video. Additionally, when the presenter talks about packages, it seems as if the presenter expects the listener to have an idea about that already.  </p> 
<br></br>
<p>Suggestions for further improvement: <br></br>
In this video lecture presented by the Scholartica Channel, I would suggest for further improvement the following. Like many instructional videos that are posted on Youtube, I would suggest subtitles. Subtitles allow for a larger viewer audience and it may even make it easier for individuals to follow along. Additionally, I would improve upon the organization of the lecture. The learning objectives presented in the beginning of the lecture should correspond to the sequential order of the lecture. Lastly, I would not assume that the viewer is well versed in all terms related </p>
